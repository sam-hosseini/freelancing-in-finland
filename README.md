## Background

### Problem

When I started freelancing in Finland as a software developer, I had to spend more than **~200 hours** to figure out how everything works.

I had questions like:

* What are the things you need to do _before_ you establish your company?
* When you setup your company, what are your recurring _obligations_?
* What kind of benefits can you offer yourself as a freelancer and how?
* and many more...

There are guides from Tax administration, Finnish Enterprise Agencies and other places to answer those questions.
However, it was painfully time consuming to extract the information I needed from those guides as the **target audience** of such
guides are the general population and the amount of details and information in them is overwhelming.

### Solution

A guide tailored specifically **to the person reading this README.md on Github**

You are the target audience of this guide if:

* You live in Finland
* You are already working as a software developer
* You want to work as an independent freelance software developer
* You want to establish a limited liability company to offer your services through it

This guide will have 3 sections.

* **Preparation**: What you need to do __before__ you establish your company
* **Foundation**: What you need to do __after__ you establish your company
* **Operation**: What you need to do to __run__ your company

I hope it saves you time 💐

## Preparation

### Immigration permit

**Source of truth**: [Finnish Immigration Service](https://migri.fi/en/)

**Steps**:
* If you're a Finnish citizen, this is not applicable to you.
* If you're a EU citizen, I don't know. Do you know? Please send a pull request 💯
* If you're a non-EU citizen, I don't know. Do you know? Please send a pull request 💯

### Freelance brokers

**What is it?** To find a project that you like, there are companies that can help you with that.
Most require a meeting before they let you in their network. It's always a relaxed meeting, though, as you will be _partners_ who will help each other.

**How does it work?** They find you a project. They add around 5-20% to your hourly rate. You invoice them. They invoice the end client.

**What happens in the meeting?**

* They ask if you know their company and depending on that, they introduce you accordingly.
* They ask about your story.
* They ask if there's an industry that you particularly like/dislike to work in.
* They ask about your hourly rate.

**What about hourly rate?** In Helsinki, if we put aside particular situations in which the client has become dependent on a single point of failure developer,
or other extraordinary situations, in an average project with an average client with an average developer, I've heard companies charging their clients between
90-130€ per hour depending on the strength of their brand, the experience of the developers in the team, and the particular relationship with that client.
In extraordinary situations, I've heard of 150-200€ per hour.

However, the ranges above are for direct company-to-client sales. If you get connected to a client using an intermediary broker company, the ranges will be cut
by 5-20%, which would be their cut of the hourly rate. This means that, with one intermediary company, you're looking at 65-105€ per hour in non-extraordinary situations.

**List of brokers**:
* Fika ☕️ with [Talented](https://talented.fi/for-talents/) and get into their Slack and Hub.
* Fika ☕️ with [Tentimes](https://www.tentimesagency.com/) and get into their Slack.
* Fika ☕️ with [Finitec](https://finitec.fi/) and get into their network.
* Fika ☕️ with [Siili One](https://campaign.siili.com/one) and get into their network.

**List of aggregate sites**:
* Create a [job search alert](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) on LinkedIn with:
  * Your `location`
  * Your most important `skill` (Python, for example)
  * Job type as `Contract`
* Create a profile on [Nordgigs](https://nordgigs.com/) which aggregates freelance projects across Nordic countries and email you on a match with your `skill` tags.

### Startup grant (starttiraha)

**Source of truth**: [TE-services startup grant page](https://www.te-palvelut.fi/te/en/employers/for_entrepreneurs/services_new_entrepreneurs/startup_grant/index.html)

**What is it?** Startup grant is a program to support you to become an entrepreneur.
You will receive the monthly payment for 6 months (if you apply once) or 12 months (if you apply for extension as well).

**How much?** ~680€ per month, as personal income. If your income tax is 25%, for example, you will get 510€.

**Steps** for first application:

* You will be disqualified from startup grant if you have already established your company or started full-time entrepreneurship.

* You need a business plan and certain financial calculations as an attachment to your application.
You can use [My Enterprise Finland](https://oma.yrityssuomi.fi/#) and complete the steps for `Business plan` to
draw up your business plan which includes all necessary financial calculations as well.

* Once you have your business plan ready, as an **optional** step, you can send an email with your business plan attached to the
[Enterprise Agency in your city](https://www.uusyrityskeskus.fi/yritysneuvonta/uusyrityskeskukset/) and ask them for an appointment with a _Business Advisor_.
In Helsinki, [_NewCo Helsinki_](https://newcohelsinki.fi/en/) is the Enterprise Agency to go to. Although it is not mandatory to go to this appointment for getting startup grant,
the _Business Advisor_ has seen hundreds of business plans and can guide you to correct your mistakes in the business plan and therefore increase your chances for a successful application.

* You need an updated Resumé as an attachment to your application.

* You need a [tax debt certificate](https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/contact-us/efil/information-on-mytax/how-to-request-a-tax-debt-certificate-in-mytax/) as an attachment to your application.

* In your business plan, you have specified how much **own funding** you have available to you.
You need to provide a proof of your claimed own funding as an attachment to your application.
This proof doesn't have to be official. I personally printed a pdf from my netbank account overview and that was enough for a successful application.
Also, the amount of money available to you, no matter how high, does not influence the decision of TE-services negatively.

* Apply for startup grant [electronically](https://asiointi.mol.fi/omaasiointi/?kieli=fi) (only available in Finnish)
and you will get an electronic decision within 2 weeks (official estimation). Official decision letter should arrive by post soon after the decision is served (~1 week).

**Steps** for  application extension:

* I don't know. Do you know? Please send a pull request 💯

### Quit your job

**What is it?** The positive decision to your startup grant is on the condition that you will quit your job and become a full-time entrepreneur.


**Steps**:
* **Terminology**: `employee` and `self-employed` are two different terms and they cannot be used interchangeably.
* As an `employee`, deliver your binding resignation in written form to your employer.
* After that, and from the first day of your startup grant decision, you are `self-employed`.

### General housing allowance (asumistuki)

**Source of truth**: [Kela general housing allowance page](https://www.kela.fi/web/en/general-housing-allowance)

**What is it?** General housing allowance supports you with housing costs.
Based on [Suomi.fi](https://www.suomi.fi/company/starting-a-business/entrepreneurs-everyday-life-and-livelyhood/guide/securing-entrepreneurs-livelihood/housing-allowance-and-basic-social-assistance-for-entrepreneurs):

> As an entrepreneur, you are entitled to the general housing allowance under the same conditions as anyone else.

**How much?** Based on the assumption that your only source of **personal** income is startup grant,
general housing allowance is ~410€ per month, tax free, for a studio in Helsinki. You can use **source of truth** calculator for exact figures.

**What counts as a `self-employed` person's income from Kela's perspective**?

* Your company:
  * is a `legal entity` with a business ID (Y-tunnus)
  * can **act** like a natural person from the perspective of law
  * pays taxes on its **profits** in the form of _corporate taxation_, 20%, once a year
* You:
  * are a `natural person` with a personal ID (Henkilötunnus)
  * are a a natural person from the perspective of law
  * pay taxes on your **income** in the form of _perosnal taxation_, at progressive rates, whenever you receive income
* For the purpose of answering _what counts as a `self-employed` person's income from Kela's perspective_, your company's income is irrelevant.
* Your income is relevant. If you have [YEL](#self-employed-persons-pensions-act-yel):
  * Your YEL `income` is counted as your income, nothing else.
  * You do not need to apply for general housing allowance review unless you change your YEL `income`.
* If you don't have YEL:
  * All your income (salary, benefits, dividends, etc) counts as your income.
  * You need to apply for general housing allowance review if your income increases by 400€ per month.

**Steps**:

* Apply for general housing allowance [electronically](https://asiointi.kela.fi/go_app) (only available in Finnish).
* Mention in application that you have received a positive decision to your startup grant application and you have quit your job.
* Attach your startup grant official decision letter which has come via post to the application.
* Attach your employment certificate which mentions the final date of your employment to the application.
* If you don't have the attachments ready, you can still attach them to the application for ~10 days after sending the application.
* You will receive a decision in ~3 weeks (official estimation).

## Foundation

### Establish your company

**Source of truth**: [Business Information System](https://www.ytj.fi/en/index.html)

**What is it?** You need to register a *limited liability* company (Oy) to be able to offer your freelance services and **protect** your **personal** assets from a legal perspective.

This *limited liability* is such an extremely important concept that I encourage you to watch [Khan Academy video on corporations and limited liability](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic/corporate-taxation/v/corporations-and-limited-liability)
and make an **informed** decision whether going for a private trader (toiminimi) is **really** the course of action you'd like to take.

**TL;DR of video**: Working under your own name as a private trader gives you **unlimited** liability and all your personal assets like your home, car, and personal savings are up for grabs if worst happens.
In case of a limited liability company, the liability is *limited* and the company can declare bankruptcy if worst happens, and your personal assets are immune from the liability of the company.


**How much?** ~280€ for online registration. It's a business cost. Later,
when your company is registered and accounting and bank account are setup,
you can claim this ~280€ back from the company as you paid this money from your *personal* bank account even though it was a *business* cost.

**What is the role of Business Information System?**

* What Local Register Office (maistraatti) is to you, Business Information System (ytj) is to your company.
* This means that in the same manner that you came to life, in the eye of Finnish authorities, by getting a personal ID (henkilötunnus) from Local Register Office,
your company will come to life by getting a company ID (Y-tunnus) from Business Information System.
* Similarly, in the same way that you update your personal information like your address after you move apartments in Local Register Office,
you'll update your company's information in Business Information System if there are changes.
* Business Information System is also the **single place** in which you can communicate with and join/exit various registries by Tax Administraion (Vero) and Finnish Patent and Registration Office (PRH).
  * Tax Administraion maintains:
    * Prepayment register (Ennakkoperintärekisteri), which allows your company to take care of its own taxes.
    * VAT register (Arvonlisäverovelvollisuus), which allows your company to report VAT related matters.
    * Employer register (Työnantajarekisteri), which allows your company to report employee-related matters.
  * Finnish Patent and Registration Office maintains:
    * Trade register (Kaupparekisteri), which stores your company's information.

**Steps**:

* Choose a company name.
  * Search for your chosen name in [Name Checking Service for Companies](https://nimipalvelu.prh.fi/nipa/en)
  * If no exact match or very-similar names were found for your chosen name, then probably it will be accepted in the application process.
  * You will be given 3 fields for company name, so prepare 2 backup names as well in case your primary name cannot be registered.

* Choose your main line of business.
  * Source of truth: [Statistics Finland](https://stat.fi/meta/luokitukset/toimiala/001-2008/index_en.html)
  * Required by Tax Administration.
  * For freelancing, you can choose any from [\[Information and communication > Computer programming, consultancy and related activities\]](https://stat.fi/meta/luokitukset/toimiala/001-2008/62_en.html)
that you feel is most relevant.
  * `62010 Computer programming activities` is common as several freelancing agencies like Futurice and Reaktor have chosen that, so you can go with that as well.

* Get another person's consent to be your *Deputy Member of the Board of Directors*.
  * According to [Limited Liability Companies Act](https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2006/en20060624.pdf) in Chapter 6, Section 8.1:
  > There  shall  be  between  one  and  five  regular  Members  of  the  Board  of Directors, unless it is otherwise provided in the Articles of Association. If there are  fewer  than  three  Members,  there  shall be  at  least one  Deputy  Member of the Board of Directors.

  * This means that, for your company to be legally compliant, it must have a *Deputy Member of the Board of Directors* when you are going to be the *only* regular member of Board of Directors as the CEO.
  * Once you get the perosn's consent, get his/her personal ID (henkilötunnus) as you'll need it for establishing the company.

* Decide the registries you'd like your company to be part of:
  * Trade register ✅, as the company cannot come into life without it.
  * Prepayment register ✅, as without it, other companies have to withhold taxes on the amounts they pay you.
  * VAT register ✅, as you can start deducting VAT from things or services you  purchase for your *main line of business*. For example, if you buy a laptop for 2,000€, you'll get ~500€ back (VAT 24%).
  * Employer register ❌, because you don't need it if you're not employing anyone else. The fact that you're employing yourself is irrelevant as you're considered `self-employed`, not an `employee`.
You can join later, once and if you start employing others.

* Establish your company online by filing a *startup notification* at [Business Information System](https://asiointi.ytj.fi/ytjap) (only available in Finnish)
  * You can also give power of attorney in Business Information System to an accountant so that they can establish the company on your behalf.

### Open a business bank account

**What is it?** A business bank account for your company's business activities.

**How much?** ~30€ per month. Base prices might start from ~10€ but in *business* accounts, unlike *personal* accounts,
almost anything that happens in the eco-system of your business will cost you something and will drive the total cost to around ~30€.

**Comparison of services**:

|        | English service | Possibility to open account online | Phone customer service |

| Nordea | ✅               | ✅                                  | ✅                      |

2. Holvi phone support is for what Holvi considers [urgent](https://support.holvi.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115005238365-Holvi-s-service-and-support),
which is mainly fraud-related activities, during weekdays. All other inquiries have to be submitted electronically.


### Find an accountant

**What is it?** Having an accountant is <ins>not mandatory by law</ins>. However, as the CEO of your company, the ultimate and final responsibility for correctness of your books
and all your company's tax obligations is on **you**, and <ins>when the law comes to you</ins> in the form of random tax audits carried out by Tax Administration, having had a
good accountant who have corrected your mistakes and fulfilled your company's tax obligations on time, every month, could prevent potential complications with Tax Administration.

**How much?** Varies. Accountants will either charge you hourly or a fixed price, which is based on their estimation of how much time they'll spend per month on your business.
A freelancing company for the target audience of this guide with no other activities will take at least an hour or two of their time,
and if we take a 75€/hour rate, you should expect to pay at least 75-150€ per month.

**List of accountants who offer English services as well**:
* [eAccounting Finland](https://www.eaccounting.fi/en/) -> Jonne Anttila
* I don't know any other. Do you know? Please send a pull request 💯

**Steps**:

* Contact your accountant in mind:
  * Explain that your business is about IT freelancing
  * Tell if you have a client already, or expecting one soon
  * Mention your estimated amount of business activity and purchases
  * Mention your bank account provider
* Accountant will take it from there.


### Self-Employed Persons’ Pensions Act (YEL)

**Source of truth**: [ETK Finnish Center for Pensions](https://www.etk.fi/en/the-pension-system/pension-security/pension-coverage-and-insurance/self-employed/)

**What is it?** YEL is a social security mandatory insurance for self-employed persons.
The name is **misleading**, as it does not only relate to your pension but to your entire social security benefits.

**What is YEL `income` and YEL `contribution`?**

* YEL `income`:
  * Has absolutely nothing to do with your income (salary, benefits, dividends, etc).
  * Is how much **"*coverage*"** in social security you would like to have.
  * You have the freedom to choose between ~7,800€ up to ~177,000€ per year.
* YEL `contribution`:
  * Is how much you **pay** for your "*coverage*".
  * Is ~19% of your YEL `income`, which means ~120€ up to ~2800€ per month as a business cost.

\* Taken from [Varma.fi YEL calculator](https://www.varma.fi/en/entrepreneur/)

**Steps**:

* You have 6 months from starting self-employment to buy YEL.
* Buy YEL from an YEL insurance provider:
  * [elo](https://www.elo.fi/?sc_lang=en)
  * [varma](https://www.varma.fi/en/)
  * [ilmarinen](https://www.ilmarinen.fi/en/)
  * [veritas](https://www.veritas.fi/en/)
* I don't know if any provider is better than the other. Do you know which one is the best? Please send a pull request 💯

### Consider buying corporate liability insurance

**What is it?** An insurance to cover the potential damages you may cause to your client while freelancing.
For example, if you drop the production database and it would take 5 hours to recover from that mistake, and
your client claims 100,000€ in damages for those 5 hours, corporate liability insurance may cover it.

**When is it necessary?** Even though it's not mandatory by law, it may be mandatory by the contract you'll sign with freelance brokers or the client itself.

**How much?** Insurance companies decide the price based on a number of factors including but not limited to your main line of business and your estimated annual revenue.
I have received offers from ~200€ up to ~500€ per year from different insurance providers.

**Corporate liability insurance providers**:
* if [corporate liability insurance](https://www.if.fi/yritysasiakkaat/vakuutukset/vastuuvakuutukset)
  * Insurance offer available in Finnish, Swedish, and English.
